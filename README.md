# Python-Project-for-Data-Science
As a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Use the labs to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

A company's stock share is a piece of the company more precisely:

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." [1]

An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day the stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges.

You are a data scientist working for a hedge fund; it's your job to determine any suspicious stock activity. In this lab you will extract stock data using a Python library. We will use the yfinance library, it allows us to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe. You will use the lab to extract.
